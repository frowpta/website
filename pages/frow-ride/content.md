## Where

Meet at the Scout Hut, on the Forest Way


## When

The event runs from 9am-12pm. Last entries will be at approximately 11am. 


## Entry Fee

£5 per entry. (Adults don't need to pay an entry fee for themselves)

## What's the event about?

The event is designed to get children cycling with friends, in a safe environment. We're so lucky to have the Forest Way running through our village. Let's make the most of it!

## What will happen?

All children will be given a card with spaces for stamps. Stamping stations will be every kilometre. Children can pick their own distance, to make the event as inclusive and friendly as possible. The furthest stamping station will be at 5 km (tbc) so that would make a round trip of 10 km. 

## How do you enter?

We'd love as many children as possible to register in advance, so we have an idea of numbers. We'll have a link up soon. You can pay online or on the day. On the day registrations are fine as well. 

## What happens when a child completes the course?

All children get a medal for taking part and free refreshments. 

## Who can take part?

All children are welcome, including smaller children on balance bikes (or riding with an adult). We do need children to be able to follow basic instructions though. See the code of conduct below.

## Do adults need to cycle with the children?

Yes, all children under 10 need to be accompanied by a responsible adult who can keep up! One adult can supervise multiple children. 

## Is there anything else happening?

There will be a barbecue at the Scout hut and refreshments for sale. 

## What if my child doesn't have a bike?

Please get in touch and we'll find your child a bike. We'll need their age, and approximate weight and height.

## Why is there an entry fee?

Part of the entry fee goes towards helping organise the event. The rest goes to Forest Row Primary School to fund enriching projects for the children. Please contact us if the entry fee is making you think twice.

## Do kids need to wear helmets?

We can't tell you to put a helmet on your kid. It's your decision. However, we strongly advise you to do so in the interests of safety. The path is hard and stony in places. It's not a good surface to smack your head against. 

## What if there's a problem with my child's bike?
We'll have wardens and at least one bike mechanic on standby. We'll do our best to help your child finish the course. Please make sure that bikes are in good condition at the start.


## Code of conduct

The Forest Way will remain open to dog walkers, other cyclists and parents with prams. We need our children to show consideration, and will ask other Forest Way users to do the same. 

1. Keep to the left, especially when there’s other bikes or walkers coming towards you
2. Slow down and give dogs plenty of space
3. Allow faster cyclists to pass
4. Think of the rider behind you. Don’t slam on the brakes suddenly!
5. Under 10s need to be accompanied by a responsible adult (who can keep up!)
6. Responsible adults can supervise more than one child
7. Children of any age can take part providing they can follow the code of conduct
8. Helmets mandatory for under 18s

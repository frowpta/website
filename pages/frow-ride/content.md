## What's the event about? 🚲

This is about getting kids riding bikes together with friends.

Each child will be given a card with spaces for stamps. We'll start at the Scout Hut in Forest Row, head along the Forest Way towards Hartfield, then back again. At each kilometre marker, we'll have a station where you can stamp your card. Choose your own distance, whether it’s 2 or 20km.

This is _not a race_. If you're looking for a challenge, why not push yourself to ride a bit further than you normally would? Can you make it to Hartfield and back? Or if that's too easy: can you do it a second time?

The Forest Way is a traffic-free route that follows a disused railway line. It’s almost flat, and it runs through miles and miles of our beautiful countryside. It’s a perfect route for kids on bikes. We're lucky to have the Forest Way running through our village. Let's make the most of it!

## How far can my child go on a bike?

You know your child best! But here are some rough guidelines.

For a child aged **1 to 3 years old**, we recommend riding 'shotgun' on a childseat, fixed to an adult bike. Aim to turn homeward after 30 minutes.

For children aged **2 to 4 years old**, we recommend using a balance bike. An adult can accompany them on foot. Aim to turn homeward at 1km, 1.5km, or 2km marker. No further! Remember that your toddler doesn't know how to pace themselves. They might say they want to keep going all the way to Hartfield, but it's too far! You'll be the one that has to carry them home, and their bike too.

From age **4 to 9 years old** a child can ride a pedal bike, accompanied by an adult on a bike. Aim to turn homeward at 3km, 5km, or 7km marker, depending on your child's ability. We don't recommend running alongside your child. A kid on a bike goes faster than most grown-ups can run!

Children aged **10 and up** may be ready to ride without a grown-up. If you're happy to let your child do that, this is a great oportunity for them to ride with support from the community. Aim to turn homeward at 5km, 6km or 7km marker.

What if you've got two or more kids of different ages? Riding in groups of mixed ability can be frustrating. If you have friends with children of similar ages, why not try a child-swap for the ride? One parent can ride with a pair of younger kids, and the other parent can ride with a pair of older kids.

## Ride with friends, ride with family

You can ride together as a family. 

This year, we've also arranged for children to set off together.

**9:30am. Preschoolers**

Bring your little ones on balance bikes or pedal bikes to ride a kilometre or two with other young cyclists. 

**10:00am. 18 km round trip.**

Encourage older kids to take on the 18km challenge with friends. Under 10s need an adult who can keep up.

**10:45am. 6 to 16 km round trip** 

Encourage your kids to have fun with friends and fellow cyclists aiming for a similar distance.

## What happens when a child completes the course? 🏅

All children get a medal for taking part and free refreshments.

## Who can take part? 👶

All children are welcome, including smaller children on balance bikes (or riding with an adult). We do need children to be able to follow basic instructions though. See the code of conduct below.

## Do adults need to cycle with the children? 👨‍👧

Yes, all children under 10 need to be accompanied by a responsible adult who can keep up! One adult can supervise multiple children. 

## What else is happening? 🍔🧃

There will be a BBQ at the Scout hut and refreshments for sale. Make sure you bring a some extra cash for after the ride.

## What if my child doesn't have a bike? 🚳

Please get in touch and we'll find your child a bike. We'll need their age, and approximate weight and height.

## Why is there an entry fee? 🫙

Part of the entry fee goes towards helping organise the event. The rest goes to Forest Row Primary School to fund enriching projects for the children. Please contact us if the entry fee is making you think twice.

## Do kids need to wear helmets? ⛑

We can't insist that you put a helmet on your kid. It's your decision. However, we strongly advise you to do so in the interests of safety. The path is hard and stony in places. It's not a good surface to smack your head against.

## What if we have bike problems? 🔧

We'll have marshalls and bike mechanics on standby. We'll do our best to help your child finish the course. Please make sure that bikes are in good condition at the start.

## Code of conduct 📜

The Forest Way will remain open to dog walkers, other cyclists and parents with prams. We need our children to show consideration, and will ask other Forest Way users to do the same. 

1. Keep to the left, especially when there’s other bikes or walkers coming towards you
2. Slow down and give dogs plenty of space
3. Allow faster cyclists to pass
4. Think of the rider behind you. Don’t slam on the brakes suddenly!
5. Under 10s need to be accompanied by a responsible adult (who can keep up!)
6. Responsible adults can supervise more than one child
7. Children of any age can take part providing they can follow the code of conduct
8. Helmets strongly advised for under 18s

These are guidelines. We're working with children. Let's do our best!

The children under your care will remain your responsibility during the event. We don't accept any liability for accidents or other problems. We're all doing our best to make sure the day runs smoothly and the kids enjoy themselves.

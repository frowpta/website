## 📝 Why You Need to Register & Pay in Advance

To keep things running smoothly, KS1 children will go straight from class to the disco — no need to leave school or come back later. That means:

* ✅ We need to know who’s attending ahead of time
* ✅ We need to be aware of any dietary needs
* ❌ We won’t be accepting cash or registrations on the day

Please help us by registering and purchasing tickets in advance. It makes everything safer, easier, and more fun for everyone! 🎈
